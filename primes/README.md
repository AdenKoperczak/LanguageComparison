# Prime Generator
This test takes a count as an argument and generates the first count primes.
It uses a simple method of checking if the current number is a multiple of any
of the last primes, and if not, it is known to be prime.

## What it Tests
These programs grow the list of primes as they find them, so there is very basic
memory allocation. Otherwise, it is simply a math based test.

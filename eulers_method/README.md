# Eulers Method
This test uses Eurlers Method to aproximate the value of a differential equation
given a starting point. Although it is set up to be able to be able to solve
a variaty of first order differential equations, only (`x^2 + 3*y^2 - 5`) is
used in this test. The only paramater that is changed is `delta_x` or the
distance each step takes.

## What it Tests
This is mostly a simple "do math in a loop" test. It can be spead up via some
code inlining.
